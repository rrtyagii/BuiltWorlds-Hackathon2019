# CS POV

CS POV is a construction site processing, organization, and visualization platform that provides image aggregation and localization capabilities to construction management for auditing and regulation purposes.

The project was conceived for BuiltWorlds2019 Hackathon. We use a dataset of images to sort and represent a construction site based on photo and report location gathered from geo-location metadata provided by a company or streamlined image collection app.

## Getting Started

Use the live demo provided at https://ontologicalsin.github.io/bw/ with the images located in the `/images` folder

## Built With
