# BuiltWorlds-Hackathon2019

This repository contains the project that I participated in. It was a challenge presented by the Clayco, Inc. 

The project is a construction site processing, organising and visualising platfrom that provides image aggregation and localisation capabilities to construction management for auditing and regulation purposes. 

## What we did :-
-Identified and classified existing project images and through analysis eliminated those that had redundant content
-Aligned the given data set with the project time line and allowing user to approve which images are to be eliminated from the set
-Created a platform to upload the images to then construct a timeline on the blueprint of that project
