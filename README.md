# BuiltWorlds-Hackathon2019

We created a construction site processing, organization, and visualization platform using JavaScript, Python and HTML/CSS that provides image aggregation, localization capabilities to construction management for auditing and regulation purposes.

## Getting Started

Use the live demo provided at https://ontologicalsin.github.io/bw/ with the images located in the `/images` folder

## What we did
- Sieved through overwhelming amount of data to check for repeated data to convert it into actionable intelligence
- Identified & classified existing project images & through analysis eliminated those that had redundant content
- Used images (data) to sort and represent a construction site based on photos, reported location from the geographical metadata

## What I learnt
- Got to learn about the JavaScript and python by working with people who are proficient in those environments 
- Got to learn about FlaskAPI, MachineLearning and Point Cloud
- Used and learnt about GitHub/Git to improve upon version control proficiency
